# Fewest-Bills
## Problem
You are working at a bank. People routinely come in to withdraw money from their accounts but always request that their money be given to them in the fewest number of bills possible. Write a program named fewest_bills.c that asks the user how much money they would like to withdraw and then tells them how many of each bill they are to receive.

You have bills in the following denominations: 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100

## Requirements
Your Program must compile with the -Wall, -Werror, and -Wextra options enabled
Assumptions
All input is valid
The user will only ask for whole dollar amounts (i.e. they won't ask for cents)
The examples provided do not represent all possible input you can receive so make sure to test your code thoroughly before submitting
